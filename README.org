* dotfiles

*My system configuration files.*

** The system

I manage my dotfiles using the symlink manager GNU stow. To
symlink files into their correct location on the system I
use the command:

=stow --dir=/**/dotfiles --target=$HOME <program-1> ...=

Where =/**/dotfiles= is the path to this repository on the
computer. The default behaviour of stow (i.e. no =--dir= or
=--target= flags) is to find <program-1> in the current
directory and create symlinks to its contents in the folder
above.

Usually I clone this repo to my $HOME directory, therefore
by =cd=ing into it and running stow on a folder without any
flags, the config files are linked to the appropriate
locations. E.g. =stow emacs= will create a symlink at
=~/.emacs= while =stow i3= will create a symlink at
=~/.config/i3/config=.
